# Draft Papers

A bunch of papers that haven't been published and other vague ideas.

## market-golden-ratio

The hypothesis in here is that the market follows a proportion similar
to the golden ratio.

## ml-recommender-system

It's in Spanish. The basic idea is to recommend programming libraries
to a project based on the textual content of a software project.

## pool-based-pso

Pool-based PSO using EvoSpace. A comparison is made against a
dynamically adapted PSO using a fuzzy system.

## fuzzy-multi-agent-gp

Multi-agent system that predicts the market using fuzzy systems with
genetic programming generated membership functions.

### interpretability-fuzzy-system

Fuzzy systems with membership functions generated by sums of
cosines. These membership functions aren't easy to interpret but the
systems perform very well.
